You run the program by in the terminal typing "./a.out".
unfortunately i could not add any bonus features due to time.
The limit of this program is that there really isnt any else other than the character creation and leveling up and of course being able to see the characters stats.
I would say the most challenging part of would be the bug fixes. For example sometimes when you would write your character name and typed in a number the program would just crash. "Hopefully" everything now should work like its supposed to.
